Installing PhotoGraphics Editor 
===============================

.. note::

  Currently, the only platform that is fully supported is Windows 32-bit.
  
  We need packages to be made for the following platforms: Windows 64-bit, Linux (and Mac?)

=======
Windows
=======

Download the .zip file from the website, extract, double-click the .exe file and enjoy!

=====
Linux
=====

There isn't a package for Linux yet so it must be built from source.

On Linux Ubuntu, it may be just easier to install the Python Andaconda environment to satisfy the requirements.

Building From Source Code
=========================

**Minimum requirements:**

* Python 3.4.3 or higher
* tkinter (Tk 8.6.1)
* PIL 4.0.0 or higher
* Scipy 0.15.0 or higher
* Numpy 1.8.1 or higher

Install the requirements listed above and run "PhotoGraphics Editor <versionstring>.py". tkinter should come with the Python distrubution; if not
you will have to install and build it yourself. Since it is pure-python, there are no files to compile manually.

.. warning::
  PhotoGraphics Editor may not run on Mac or Linux out-of-the-box because of some Windows-only features that need to be adjusted.
