<b>About</b>
</p>
<p class="p4">
PhotoGraphics Editor is a free and open source image editing program
written in the Python Programming Language.
</p>
<p class="p4">
 This project's aim is to create a user-friendly, yet powerful and feature-rich image editor 
which allows Python programmers to easily write plugins for specific image manipulation functions, 
etc. built on this pre-built program framework. 
</p>
<p class="p4">
PhotoGraphics Editor is currently available for Windows XP 32-bit OS and higher.
The entire source code is available for download for free.
</p>

<p class="p3">
<b>Version 1.0.0</b>
</p>
<p class="p4">
PhotoGraphics Editor 1.0.0 is the first release after over a year of development. 
Version 1.0.0 adds the new <em>Create Gradient</em> option, an update of the previous <em>Resize tool</em>, 
major fixes to the <em>Add Text tool</em> UI, better stability and error handling, plus many bug fixes.
</p>
<p class="p3">
<b>Features</b>
</p>
<p class="p4">

</p>
<p class="p4">
8 main tools have been implemented as of version 1.0.0, including Crop, Clone, Add Text, Layer, Generate Normal Map and more.

Standard editing functions such as image transforms and converting between image modes are included with the
