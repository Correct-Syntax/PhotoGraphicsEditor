# PhotoGraphics Editor

> 12/16/2025 Note: This is a project from 2018 when I was first learning Python. There's almost certainly bad code and bugs here. However, for historical reasons I'm open-sourcing it, as it was originally intended. If someone can get use out of the application or the source code I'll be more than happy.

PhotoGraphics Editor is a free and open-source image and texture editing program written in the Python programming language. It also provides an API for Python developers to write plugins for PhotoGraphics Editor using the built-in libraries.

See the documentation (docs/index.html) for information.

This source code is from 2018 so it probably requires an older version of Python, etc.
